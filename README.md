# NUS Physics Engagement (14-15 Dec 2023)  

Attended the NUS Physics Engagement, covering advanced topics such as quantum materials, black holes, quantum communication, and gravity. Gained insights into fundamental concepts, including:  

- **Transistors and Computing:** Explored the role of transistors in CPUs, the implications of Moore's Law, and the challenges of computing efficiency, including the Von Neumann bottleneck.  
- **Neuromorphic Computing:** Investigated brain-like computing architectures, achieving high processing speeds with low power consumption.  
- **Superconductors:** Studied the behavior of superconductors at critical temperatures, including BCS theory and the Meissner effect.  
- **Black Holes and General Relativity:** Analyzed the formation of black holes, Schwarzschild radius, and the principles of gravitational time dilation.  
- **Quantum Computing:** Differentiated between classical bits and quantum bits (qubits), discussing the transfer of quantum information and the significance of the uncertainty principle.  


# NUS Physics Flash QCamp (19 June 2024)  

Participated in the NUS Physics Flash QCamp, focusing on advanced concepts in quantum physics, superconductors, and quantum computing. Key topics covered include:  

- **Quantum Physics Fundamentals:** Explored the basics of qubits, including computational and orthonormal bases, superposition, and measurement principles as described by Born's Rule.  
- **Entanglement:** Examined the nature of entanglement, measurement probabilities, and correlations. Discussed historical perspectives through the lens of Einstein and Bohr, along with the implications of the CHSH game and Bell's Theorem.  
- **Superconductors:** Investigated properties and types of superconductors, the significance of Cooper pairs, and the functioning of the Josephson Junction.  
- **Quantum Computing with Qibo:** Gained hands-on experience with the Qibo framework, covering quantum logic gates, measurement techniques, and applications of the Hadamard gate.
