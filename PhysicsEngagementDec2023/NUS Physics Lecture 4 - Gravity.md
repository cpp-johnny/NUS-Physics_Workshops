### 1543 Copernicus' heliocentric model
- planets move around sun

### ~1589 Galileo 
- objects move down with fixed acceleration
$$ s \propto t^2 $$

or we know it as 

$$ F = mg $$

### 1609 Kepler's Law
- planets orbit the sun in ellipses
- proposed an attractive force between all bodies 

$$ T^2 \propto r^3 $$

### 1687 Newton's Law of motion and gravitation
> however it is not the most accurate!!

<br> 

### 1905 Einstein's Special Relativity
$$ E = mc^2 $$


### 1915 Einstein's General Relativity
- gravity as a fictitious force (curvature of spacetime)


## Newton's Gravity
- all bodies attract one another

$$ F = \frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2} $$
### Problem 
- Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism states that $c$ is the same for all observers. However that is incompatible with Newton's Law of Motion. 
- NL don't work well in stronger gravitational fields and high speeds.


## General Relativity
- curvature of spacetime causes gravitation
$$ G _{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G }{c^4} T _{\mu\nu}  $$
### Evidences of GR:
1. Eddington 1919 picture
2. Pulsar
3. Black Holes 

### What GR does not explain
1. dark matter
2. dark energy and expanding universe
3. black hole singularities
4. quantum theory of gravity
5. "spooky action at a distance"
