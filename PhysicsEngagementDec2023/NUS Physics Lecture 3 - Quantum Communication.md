### Quantum Bit (Qubit) VS Bit
- classical computing: 0 or 1
- quantum computing: can be simultaneously 0 and 1

### How to transfer quantum information between quantum computers, sensors and meteorology?
- use light -> optical fibre/free space/telescope (as long as they are in the line of sight)

$$ c = f \lambda$$
with the refractive index

$$ c = \frac{c_0}{n}, \; \lambda = \frac{\lambda _ 0}{n}$$

### What is quantum about light?
- Gaussian Beam 
- ![[Pasted image 20231215095918.png]]
- according to Planck's Equation 
$$ E = hv $$
- probability of finding photon at centre is higher than the edge


<br>
- uncertainty principle <br>
- no-cloning theorem

<br>
