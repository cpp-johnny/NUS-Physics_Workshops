Quantum entanglement is a fundamental phenomenon in quantum mechanics where two or more particles become interconnected in such a way that the quantum state of one particle cannot be described independently of the state of the other particle(s), even when the particles are separated by large distances. This means that measurements performed on one particle instantly influence the state of the other entangled particle, no matter how far apart they are.

# Single Qubit

 - 2 well defined states, $\ket{0}$, $\ket{{1}}$
 - superposition: 
 $$\alpha_{0} \ket{0} + \alpha_{1} \ket{1} \qquad |\alpha_{0}|^2 + |\alpha_{1}|^2 = 1$$

$$P(0) = |\alpha_{0}|^2 \qquad P(1) = |\alpha_{1}|^2$$
 
 - notation: 
 $$\ket{+} = \frac{\ket{0}+ \ket{1}}{\sqrt{2}} \qquad \ket{-} = \frac{\ket{0} - \ket{1}}{\sqrt{2}}$$
 - measure $\ket{+} = \frac{\ket{0} + \ket{1}}{\sqrt{ 2 }}$ in:
 $$\{\ket{0}, \ket{1} \} \space\space basis  \rightarrow 50\% \space \text{probability of 0 and 50\% probablity in 1}$$
 $$\{\ket{+}, \ket{-} \} \space\space basis  \rightarrow 100\% \space \text{probability of + and 0\% probablity in } -$$
 
# Two Qubit

 Alice:
 
$$\ket{\psi} = \alpha_{0} \ket{0} + \alpha_{1} \ket{1} $$

Bob:

$$\ket{\psi} = \beta_{0} \ket{0} + \beta_{1} \ket{1}$$

- combination of $\ket{0}_{A} \otimes \ket{0}_{B}, \quad \ket{1}_{A} \otimes \ket{0}_{B}, \quad \ket{0}_{A} \otimes \ket{1}_{B}, \quad \ket{1}_{A} \otimes \ket{1}_{B}$
- notation: $\ket{0}_{A} \otimes \ket{0}_{B} \equiv \ket{00}_{AB} \equiv \ket{00}$
- join state: $\ket{\psi}_{A} \otimes \ket{\phi}_{B} = (\alpha_{0} \ket{0} + \alpha_{1}\ket{1}) \otimes (\beta_{0}\ket{0} + \beta_{1}\ket{1}) = \alpha_{0}\beta_{0}\ket{00} + \alpha_{1}\beta_{0}\ket{10} + \alpha_{0}\beta_{1} \ket{01} + \alpha_{1}\beta_{1} \ket{11}$
# Measurement Probabilities


$$\ket{State \space1} = \frac{\ket{00} + \ket{10} + \ket{01} + \ket{11}}{2} \rightarrow P_{A}(0) = \frac{1}{2}, \quad P_{A}(1) = \frac{1}{2}, \quad P_{B}(0) = \frac{1}{2}, \quad P_{B}(1) = \frac{1}{2}$$
$$
P_{A}(0) = |\frac{1}{2}|^2 + |\frac{1}{2}|^2 = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}
$$

$$\ket{State \space 2} = \frac{\ket{00} + \ket{11}}{\sqrt{ 2 }} \rightarrow P_{A}(0) = \frac{1}{2}, \quad P_{A}(1) = \frac{1}{2}, \quad P_{B}(0) = \frac{1}{2}, \quad P_{B}(1) = \frac{1}{2}$$

# Entanglement is in the corelations

$$
\ket{State 1} = \frac{\ket{00} + \ket{10} + \ket{01} + \ket{11}}{2} 
$$

$$
P\begin{pmatrix}\text{A measures }0\\\text{B measures }1\end{pmatrix}\equiv P(01)=\frac{1}{4}
$$


$$
\ket{State \space 2} = \frac{\ket{00} + \ket{11}}{\sqrt{ 2 }}
$$

$$
P(01) = 0
$$

> only when A and B share their results, they realise they are entangled! 

# An underwhelming definition

A state $\ket{\phi}$ is separable if $\ket{\phi}_{AB} = \ket{\psi}_{A} \otimes \ket{\phi}_{B}$. Otherwise, it is entangled (cannot be factored into a product of states of the individual subsystems)

Example of entangled state:

$$
\ket{S1} = \frac{\ket{01} + \ket{10} }{\sqrt{ 2 }} 
$$

$$
\ket{S2} = \frac{\ket{01} - \ket{01} + \ket{10} + \ket{11}}{2}  
$$


# Einstein VS Bohr

| Team Einstein                              |                  Team Bohr                   |
| :----------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------: |
| States are well defined before measurement |  States are indetermined before measurement  |
| QM is incomplete, needs hidden varaibles   |      QM is complete, and probabilistic       |
| Physics must be local                      | Entanglement produces non-local correlations |


The philosophical implication of quantum mechanics caused a huge debate between Einstein and Bohr. One important argument of Einstein is that quantum mechanics is incomplete, resulting in the “EPR Paradox” proposed in 1935. The paradox was not solved until 1964 by John Bell (via Bell's inequality), where quantum mechanics emerged victorious. This was done by using long-distance correlations of particles in quantum mechanics, called quantum entanglement. Since then, quantum entanglement has been applied to quantum cryptography, a method of encryption that cannot be hacked if applied correctly (refer to Quantum Key Distribution, Entanglement & Teleportation, and Bell Nonlocality). 
# The CHSH Game

Rules:
1. Alice and Bob collaborate to win
2. They can not communicate once the game starts  
3.  The referee sends a random input x, y to Alice and Bob  
4. Alice and Bob can only see their own input, not each other's  
5. Winning condition: 
	- If xy are 00, 01 or 10 they must answer differently  
	- Only if xy is 11 they must answer the same

What's the best strategy Alice and Bob can use?

## Attempt 1: always output 0


| x,y | Winning condition | a   | b   | Win? |
| --- | ----------------- | --- | --- | ---- |
| 00  | Different answer  | 0   | 0   | N    |
| 01  | Different answer  | 0   | 0   | N    |
| 10  | Different answer  | 0   | 0   | N    |
| 11  | Same answer       | 0   | 0   | Y    |

Winning probability:

$$
P_{win} = \frac{1}{4} P_{win}(0,0) + \frac{1}{4} P_{win}(0,1) + \frac{1}{4} P_{win}(1,0) + \frac{1}{4} P_{win}(1,1) = \frac{1}{4}
$$

## Attempt 2: always mirror the referree


| x,y | Winning condition | a   | b   | Win? |
| --- | ----------------- | --- | --- | ---- |
| 00  | Different answer  | 0   | 0   | N    |
| 01  | Different answer  | 0   | 1   | Y    |
| 10  | Different answer  | 1   | 0   | Y    |
| 11  | Same answer       | 1   | 1   | Y    |

Winning probability:

$$
P_{win} = \frac{1}{4} P_{win}(0,0) + \frac{1}{4} P_{win}(0,1) + \frac{1}{4} P_{win}(1,0) + \frac{1}{4} P_{win}(1,1) = \frac{3}{4}
$$
# Bell Theorem

you can never get $P_{win} > \frac{3}{4}$ by playing the game classically!

Proof:

Alice will always output $f(x)$, Bob will always output $g(y)$, where $f$ and $g$ are deterministic functions.

$x, y= 1, 0\to$ A and B need different answers$\to f( 1) \neq g( 0)$ 

$x, y= 1, 1\to$ A and B need the same answer$\to f( 1) = g( 1)$

$x,y=0,1\to A$ and B need different answers $\to f(0)\neq g(1)$

$x,y=0,0\to A$ and B need different answers but $f(0)\neq g(0)$ so $f(0)=g(1)$

Only 3 out of 4 conditions can be satisfied at a time! Any classical probabilistic strategy cannot be better than the best deterministic one!



# Solution: use quantum entanglement!


$$
\ket{\psi} = \frac{\ket{01} - \ket{10} }{\sqrt{ 2 }} 
$$


If $x = 0$,  Alice measures in $A_{0} = \{ \ket{0}, \ket{1} \}$ basis

If $x = 1$,  Alice measures in $A_{1} = \{ \ket{+}, \ket{-} \}$ basis

If $y = 0$,  Bob measures in $B_{0} = \{ \ket{\frac{\pi}{8}}, \ket{\frac{5\pi}{8}} \}$ basis

If $y = 0$,  Bob measures in $B_{1} = \{ \ket{\frac{-\pi}{8}}, \ket{\frac{3\pi}{8}} \}$ basis

$$
P_{win} =\frac{1}{4}\left\langle\psi|A_{0}\otimes B_{0}|\psi\right\rangle+\frac{1}{4}\left\langle\psi|A_{0}\otimes B_{1}|\psi\right\rangle+ \\
+\frac{1}{4}\langle\psi|A_{1}\otimes B_{0}|\psi\rangle+\frac{1}{4}\langle\psi|A_{1}\otimes B_{1}|\psi\rangle 
$$

Trick: use $\ket{\psi}$ = $\frac{\ket{01}-\ket{10}}{\sqrt{ 2 }} = \frac{\ket{-+}-\ket{+-}}{\sqrt{ 2 }}$

$$
P_{win} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2\sqrt{ 2 }} \approx 86\% > \frac{3}{4}
$$



# We need to close the loopholes!

- minimise the assumptions of the the experiment
- ambiguities $\rightarrow$ false violation of Bell's inequality
- detection loophole: null rounds can modify statistics
- free choice loophole: referee inputs must be truly random
- locality loopholes: A and B must measure faster than light takes to travel from one to another. 
- memory loopholes: detectors may have memory about the past rounds, so outcomes may be correlated.

# Teleportation protocol

Alice wants to send the quantum state:

$$
|\phi\rangle_A = \alpha_0 |0\rangle + \alpha_1 |1\rangle
$$

Alice and Bob share an entangled Bell state:

$$
|\psi\rangle_{AB} = \frac{|01\rangle - |10\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}
$$

The combined state of Alice’s qubit and the entangled pair is:

$$
|\phi\psi\rangle_{AAB} = (\alpha_0 |0\rangle + \alpha_1 |1\rangle)_A \otimes \frac{|01\rangle - |10\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}_{AB}
$$

Expanding:

$$
|\phi\psi\rangle_{AAB} = \frac{\alpha_0 |0\rangle |01\rangle + \alpha_1 |1\rangle |01\rangle - \alpha_0 |0\rangle |10\rangle - \alpha_1 |1\rangle |10\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}
$$

Rewriting in terms of Bell states:

$$
|\phi\psi\rangle_{AAB} = \frac{1}{2} \Big[
|\Phi_0\rangle_{AA} (-\alpha_0 |0\rangle - \alpha_1 |1\rangle)_B +
|\Phi_1\rangle_{AA} (-\alpha_0 |0\rangle + \alpha_1 |1\rangle)_B +
|\Phi_2\rangle_{AA} (\alpha_1 |0\rangle + \alpha_0 |1\rangle)_B +
|\Phi_3\rangle_{AA} (-\alpha_1 |0\rangle + \alpha_0 |1\rangle)_B
\Big]
$$

Each Bell state measurement outcome corresponds to a unitary operation Bob must apply to recover the original state.


# State Recovery

The final entangled state:

$$
|\phi\psi\rangle_{AAB} = \frac{-|\Phi_0\rangle_{AA} (\alpha_0 |0\rangle + \alpha_1 |1\rangle)_B 
+ |\Phi_1\rangle_{AA} (-\alpha_0 |0\rangle + \alpha_1 |1\rangle)_B 
+ |\Phi_2\rangle_{AA} (\alpha_1 |0\rangle + \alpha_0 |1\rangle)_B 
+ |\Phi_3\rangle_{AA} (-\alpha_1 |0\rangle + \alpha_0 |1\rangle)_B}{2}
$$

- The states $\{|\Phi_0\rangle, |\Phi_1\rangle, |\Phi_2\rangle, |\Phi_3\rangle\}$ form the Bell basis.
- Alice measures in the Bell basis $\Rightarrow$ 25% probability of finding each $|\Phi_i\rangle$.
- Alice communicates to Bob the correction operation to recover the correct state.

# Correction Table
| Alice measures | Bob state collapse | Correction | Bob final state |
|---------------|-------------------|------------|-----------------|
| \|Φ₀⟩ₐₐ | α₀\|0⟩ + α₁\|1⟩ | Nothing | α₀\|0⟩ + α₁\|1⟩ |
| \|Φ₁⟩ₐₐ | -α₀\|0⟩ + α₁\|1⟩ | \|0⟩ → -\|0⟩ | α₀\|0⟩ + α₁\|1⟩ |
| \|Φ₂⟩ₐₐ | α₁\|0⟩ + α₀\|1⟩ | \|0⟩ ↔ \|1⟩ | α₀\|0⟩ + α₁\|1⟩ |
| \|Φ₃⟩ₐₐ | -α₁\|0⟩ + α₀\|1⟩ | \|0⟩ ↔ -\|1⟩ | α₀\|0⟩ + α₁\|1⟩ |

## Notes:
1. The **correction column** describes what Bob must do based on Alice's measurement.
2. Swaps ($\leftrightarrow$) indicate flipping between $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$.
3. A **negative sign** means Bob applies a phase flip.
