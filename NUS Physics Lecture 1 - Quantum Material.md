<br> 

main  electrical component of CPU --> transistor (aka Field Effect transistor, FET)
semiconductor --> silicon, germanium (old)

### where do the heat come from? 
- charging of gate capacitor
- resistance of e<sup>-</sup>  flow
- power leakage (↑ as transistors get smaller)
- power density of CPU now is ~ 1 Watt/cm<sup>2</sup>

<br> 

### Moore's Law 
- if keep making transistor smaller, it would not be sustainable 

<br>

### Neuromorphic computing (brain)

- 1 exaFLOPS (10<sup>18</sup>) calculations per second
- 20 watts

<br>

### Computing Efficiency Problem
- Von Neumann "bottleneck"
- power hungry architecture
- memory and processor are separated
- sequential operation ==VS== parallel/concurrent

<br>

### Superconductor
- normal material have resistance (atomic vibration), for metal when temp ↑, R ↑
- however when cooled to critical temperature T<sub>c</sub>, R will drop to 0

- BCS theory 
- Meissner effect (magnetic repulsion - magnetic levitation)
